Polygon Validator Monitoring Tool

A Node.js and Docker-based monitoring tool that observes and ensures the proper functioning of a Polygon validator node. It's designed to help operators detect issues like missed checkpoints and synchronization problems between Bor and Heimdall (the two key components of the Polygon network infrastructure).

ðŸ§© Use Case
Imagine you're running a validator node on the Polygon PoS network. This tool keeps watch on it 24/7 and notifies you instantly via Telegram if something goes wrong â€” helping you prevent slashing, downtime, or missed rewards.

Features

- Tracks validator activity (signed/proposed checkpoints)
- Monitors sync status of Bor and Heimdall nodes
- Sends real-time alerts via Telegram for:
- Missed checkpoints
- Out-of-sync Bor or Heimdall nodes
- Easy configuration through a single file
- Dockerized for smooth deployment

  ðŸ”” Alerts
This monitor sends alerts to Telegram using a bot. You will receive alerts if:
  Your validator misses checkpoints
  Heimdall or Bor fall out of sync
Ensure your Telegram Bot and Chat ID are configured in .env.
